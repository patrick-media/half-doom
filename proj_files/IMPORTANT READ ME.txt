TO ADD FILES:
Make a folder using the naming scheme below.
DO NOT UPLOAD BUILDS HERE. THEY TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE AND WILL SLOW YOUR UPLOAD. MINE WITH 8 BUILDS IS ALREADY 400 MB.
IMPOTRANT FOLDERS/FILES TO ADD:
Assets
Library
obj
Packages
ProjectSettings
Assembly-CSharp.csproj
Half-Doom.sln

You are literally unable to add the .vs file, so don't try. It's hidden and will most likely auto generate.

PLEASE USE THIS NAMING SCHEME:
MM-DD-YYYY_YOURNAME_NUMBER
Example:
4-22-21_patrick_1
The second upload on this day would be:
4-22-21_patrick_2
And so on. thx
