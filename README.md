# Half-Doom
This project is a mix of the original Half-Life, and the original DOOM / DOOM II.
There will be builds uploaded under their appropriate number incrementing by 1 each time.

Current project: make the UI look normal (currently takes up half of the screen, don't know why).

TODO: (in order)
Complete UI functionality:
  sometimes esc doesn't escape prompts
  sometimes Y doesn't quit the game when prompted
  sometimes the game GUI becomes unnecessarily inexplicably large & poorly scaled
Complete use-key functionality (Source / GoldSrc style)
Complete textures
Weapon sysem
Make levels
Enemies: AI & models
